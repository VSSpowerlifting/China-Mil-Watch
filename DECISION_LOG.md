# DECISION_LOG — China Mil Watch

Newest first. Record decisions that constrain future work.

## 2026-07-10 — Analyst rulings on historical gaps

- `the-pla-watch/linkedin/2026-05-10.txt` is most likely the pilot edition's
  LinkedIn post under its publish date. Left unrenamed.
- Editions 1–2 trails carry no `is_significant` flags because no significant
  articles arose those weeks. The n_significant counts (1, 3) in early
  sidecars are pipeline auto-counts; reconciling them is the analyst's call.
- 2026-06-20's missing "Why It Matters" section stays as published.

## 2026-07-10 — Original Chinese headlines in the source trail

Trail entries carry `title_zh`, sourced only from the daily-monitoring DB's
`title_original` by exact URL match (100% coverage, all 9 editions).
`generate_pla_watch.py` includes it for new editions; the backfill tool fills
history. Chinese text is never composed, retranslated, or fuzzily matched.

## 2026-07-09 — Sidecar JSON is the canonical edition record

Sidecars now store full body text alongside metadata and the source trail.
Rationale: 7 of 9 sidecars had no body fields, so the "safe" re-render script
would have silently replaced published prose with empty pages. Body text was
backfilled by extraction from the published HTML (verified verbatim — a
round-trip check confirmed every paragraph identical) and
`generate_pla_watch.py` writes body fields at publish time.
`rerender_pla_watch.py` refuses empty-body sidecars without
`--allow-empty-body`.

## 2026-07-09 — Both weekly renderers share one Jinja environment

`scripts/pw_env.py` with autoescape ON (the generator previously rendered
unescaped model output) plus `format_date` and `inline_markup` filters.
`inline_markup` whitelists bare `<strong>`/`<em>` because the 2026-05-16
sidecar carries literal emphasis tags; everything else is escaped.

## 2026-07-09 — Date display convention

Reader-facing week-ending labels use "4 July 2026"; ISO `YYYY-MM-DD` is kept
in tabular/meta contexts (covers range, snapshot sub-labels, JSON). Do not
mix within one label.

## 2026-07-09 — Historical data gaps are warnings, never fixed by invention

Missing per-item trail dates (editions 1–3), missing LinkedIn files
(editions 1–3), missing `is_significant` flags (editions 1–2), the pilot's
2-day window, and the 2026-06-20 missing "Why It Matters" section stay as
recorded facts + validator warnings. Only two normalizations were allowed:
`label`→`title` key rename (same string) and pilot trail `source` filled from
its single-entry `sources_seen` (what the published page already displayed).

## 2026-07-09 — Public role title

"Principal Analyst, China Mil Watch" everywhere (scripts, sidecars, pages).
Bio phrase: "principal analyst at China Mil Watch".

## 2026-07-09 — Issue numbering

Chronological No. 1–9 assigned from week-ending order, stored in sidecars,
displayed as "Vol. I · No. N", validated unique + chronological. New editions:
1 + count of earlier sidecars.
